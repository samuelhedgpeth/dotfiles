## New Machine

When setting up a new machine, run this command in Terminal:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuelhedgpeth/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/setup.sh)"
```

This will:

- Install brew
- Install gh and authenticate
- Clone this repository to `~/dotfiles`

Restart your terminal after you run this in order for it to know brew is there.

## Initial Setup

Once this repository is cloned with the above process, navigate to `~/dotfiles`
and run `./update.sh`, which:

- Ensures all Apple updates are completed
- Installs all brew packages
- Creates symlinks for dotfiles to their normal locations
- Sets up AI

## XCode

After initial setup, XCode needs to be updated from the App Store and started.

After it is started, run this command to ensure Swift tools are available on
the terminal:

```sh
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

```

## Update

From here to ensure everything is proper, run `update`. It's meant to be run
as many times as you want.

## Configure

To configure settings, run `configure.sh` and restart your mac.

## Secrets

Copy `.env.template` to `~/.env` and add the appropriate values.
